2. Registration of user to the wallet - authentication and wallet linkage: ICICI APIs

User has to choose a avatar and nickname.

3. Virtual Public Address and private key is generated (private key will be stored locally in the device) - IBM Bluemix Blockchain network: New user is created with value set as the current balance in his/her ICICI account.

Two people will be involved - User and the biller. Biller will generate the bill and the user is going to pay the biller using the wallet.

4. Biller will enter the amount and hit receive button - two options: receive by only vpa or both vpa and gps.
5. User will hit pay button - two options: pay to vpa or gps.
6. if vpa: user has to enter the vpa or scan the vpa.
   if gps: map will open and user has to select the biller in the map (avatar and the nickname will be used to identify).
